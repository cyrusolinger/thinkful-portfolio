          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Since graduating college I have continued sharpening my skills
            through various technical jobs and certifications. I currently am a
            Software Support Analyst at First American Financial.
          </p>
          <p>
            The development space has really interested me due to the creative
            and challenging aspects of it. I have soft studied programming for
            the past couple years and feel that I am ready to take the leap and
            become serious about my studies to pursue a career in software
            engineering. This was ultimately why I decided to structure my
            journey through Thinkful. Although I haven't been here long, I have
            already had a great chat with my mentor and have been more motivated
            than ever!
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been around tech my entire life, but when I'm not at a
            computer some of the things I like to do include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Traveling to new places</li>
            <li>Playing sports with friends</li>
            <li>Work on side projects/businesses</li>
          </ul>
          <p>NBA Goats</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Lebron James</li>
            <li>Michael Jordan</li>
